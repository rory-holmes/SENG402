Initial loss function was using sparse cross entropy loss.
    This was bad as it was throwing a mismatch of labels and logits. The output for this was a probability distribution of target classes.
    Solution was to change this to binary_crossentropy.

Computer has run out of memory when loading all frames from all the videos.
    Solution is to alter the pipeline to receive one video at a time.

For evaluations:
    Use cross entropy loss function, gets raw output. Can see if learning or overfitting.
    Confusion matrix. F1 score.
    
Future plan:
    Make custom callback, when loss isnt decreasing too much, start unfreezing the model and training, do this recursively until model performance decreases on unseen data.
    Gradually reduce learning rate with optimizers.schedules
    Remove all frames where tools do not corolate well with colorectal surgery, potentially remove frames where its not in the body?
